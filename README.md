Navigation & Scrolling
--------

- shorten vertical scrolling between panels - OK
>I implemented that with absolute scrolling values and costant values of sections height. Check after `<div id="fullpage">` for info. 
- Activate arrow keys as navigation between panels - OK
>I added jQuery easing plugin and revised a bit your code. We now have arrow keys and page up and down for moving between panels. 

Illustrations

Design
---------

- reposition text so it’s not covering the product (per ryu’s comments) - OK? 

Mobile & Testing
-------

>All Leo stuff :)
